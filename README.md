# CS340_Bikes_DB_PowerBI

This project encompasses a comprehensive walkthrough aimed at exporting data from an operational database and transforming it for use in a new analytical database. The primary objective is to analyze past sales trends, particularly focusing on the Adventure Bikes 2014 sales data. This process involves several critical steps, including backing up your project database, transforming the data, and creating insightful reports using Power BI.

The pdf includes the schema with the CS 340 database, provided that the table names do not conflict with those in the operational database adventurebikes2014. This ensures a seamless process without affecting the operational database's integrity.

As part of the assignment, I created a Power BI report to analyze the Adventure Bikes 2014 Sales Data, demonstrating the practical application of BI analysis to mine raw data and identify patterns, relationships, and trends.
